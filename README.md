## System Architecture

1. **Database Query:**
   - Retrieves user details (`Id`, `Name`, `Email`, `DateOfBirth`) from the `BUsers` table.
   - Filters based on the current date using SQL queries.

2. **Email Composition:**
   - Creates an HTML email with a birthday message and an embedded image.
   - Embeds the image as a `LinkedResource` to ensure proper rendering in email clients.

3. **Email Sending:**
   - Utilizes the `SmtpClient` class for sending emails.
   - Handles SMTP errors gracefully and retries if necessary.

4. **Logging:**
   - Records all email-sending activities in a log file.
   - Logs errors with timestamps for debugging and tracking.
